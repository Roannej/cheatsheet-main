        <!--HTML DESCRIPTION-->
        <p>What is HTML?</p>
        <p>HTML stands for <em>Hyper Text Markup Language</em>, and is used
         to define the structure of a webpage. Without it, you cannot organize text, 
        add images or media resources to your webpages. HTML is the base, like a 
        skeleton.</p>

                        or other special characters that would be difficult to 
                        generate with a typical keyboard. In fact, using reference 
                        numbers, an entity can represent any Unicode character. 
                        When parsing the HTML, a browser replaces the entity's 
                        character sequence with the character it represents.<br>
                        Entities are case-sensitive and can take one of three forms. 
                        The first form references an entity by name: <strong>&amp;name;</strong> , 
                        The second form references it by the decimal Unicode number: <strong>
                         &amp;#number;</strong> and the third represents it with the hexadecimal Unicode

                        &lt;iframe&gt; element provides a smaller version of a 
                        browser window that contains various media, such as an 
                        advertisement, a YouTube video, etc. Some sites such as 
                        Youtube will provide IFrame markup for the user to embed 
                        instead of making one on their own. These smaller windows 
                        are known as “browsing contexts”, because the URL passed 
                        to the &lt;iframe&gt; tag is still functional as a web page. 
                        This makes their usage somewhat controversial as many 
                        commercial websites have safeguards against their URL being 
                        passed to this particular element.<br>

                    <td id="text-format">There are two ways to format text with HTML. 
                        One way is to use HTML tags, which specify some characteristic 
                        of the text that should cause it to render differently. The 
                        other way is to use CSS typography properties to define 
                        specific formatting for a text element. 
                        Note: Modern HTML specifications eschew using HTML tags to 
                        specify specific formatting of elements (bold, underline, 
                        italic etc.), instead using HTML to describe the characteristics 
                        of the text, allowing the software rendering the HTML to decide 
                        how tags are displayed. Best practice to define specific styling 
                        of text is to use CSS.</td>

                        Similar to serving images, serving videos raise concerns 
                        about the impact on users due to greater bandwidth 
                        requirements as well as the less accessible nature of the 
                        medium.</td>
