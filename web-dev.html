        <h1>The Internet &amp; Web Development</h1>
        <h2>Study Notes</h2>

        <p>Computers connected to the internet are called clients and servers. 
            Clients = your devices (i.e. laptop via wifi, cellphone via mobile 
            network)
            Servers = computers that store all the info you access with your 
            'client' device (i.e. websites and Apps).</p>

        <p>Requirements for clients and servers to 'communicate' with each other.</p>
         <ul>
            <li>Internet Connection</li>
            <li>TCP/IP = Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol = 
                Protocol that allows your device/internet connection to safely 
                send data/packets to request/receive the information you requested.</li>
            <li>DNS = Domain Name System = A website address is an IP address 
                (on which server the information lives), to make it easier for us 
                mere humans to remember, there is a DNS (address book) that keeps 
                record of the IP address vs the domain name. This allows you to 
                request data from the domain name instead of remembering/inputting 
                the IP address for the webpages or site you are looking for.</li>
            <li>HTTP = Hyper Text Transfer Protocol = set of rules that devices 
                use to communicate with each other over the internet in order 
                to send and receive data.</li>
            <li>Component Files = The different files that make up a website.
                There are two types - Code Files (i.e. HTML & CSS) and Asssets 
                (i.e. Images, music, videos,.. Media resources.)
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Process flow for clients and servers to communicate with each other &colon;</p>
        <p>Browser requests website/data &rarr; DNS finds the correct address
            where the data lives &rarr; Browser (using TCP/IP) sends and HTTP 
            request to the server requesting the data you want shown on your 
            desktop/device &rarr; server returns requested data in small packets 
            &rarr; browser reassembles data for your view on your monitor.</p>

        <p>Component file parsing order = HTML (checks for additional links), then 
            parses these links such as CSS and JS depending on the structure of the 
            HTML instructions.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML = Structures website content</li>
            <li>CSS = Applies styling to websites</li>
            <li>JS = Adds interactivity to websites</li>
            <li>SQL = ALlows your web application to stoore and retrieve data</li>
        </ul>
